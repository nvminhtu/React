* fundamentals: for basic javscript
* es6: for coding es6
* You can code export/import - call by importing to index.
* View result of App build: inside folder `app` - type `live-server` so that you can run the webpage
* How to update code? in `resource` folder - view `index.js` - it is an entry point. We `require` it so that we can build source to app dist
